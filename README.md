# Template-Engine-Employee-Summary

This is an application that generates an software engineering team via the command line. 

## Instructions

The application will first ask for information regarding the manager and then for the team members. The user may input an number of team numbers and they can be a mix of engineers and interns. Once the user inputs all the team member information, the application will generate a HTML file with a nicely formatted team roster.
